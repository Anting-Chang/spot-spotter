Montreal downtown parking hard to find?
Afraid that you cannot find a place when your friend invite you for dinner in Guy Concordia?
This website solves all of your problems!!

## How is it different?

Everybody got a parking app. Special power of my website is the filter. While other app filter to see if you can park there. I filter when you can't.
You might ask: what's the point, if I can't even park there? The thing about downtown parking is, usually... I mean almost at all time the free parking is full.
However, there are times when its totally empty. You guessed it, when the 'no parking' timer ends. You are guaranteed a spot. 

## Currently in test phase, and still as a personal project

Every account you registered, or the spots being put in might be removed later. Website maybe shut down at any time.
