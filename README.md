Montreal downtown parking hard to find?
Afraid that you cannot find a place when your friend invite you for dinner in Guy Concordia?
This website solves all of your problems!!

## How to use it?
### Use filter
Imagine that you are in downtown , all spots are likely full. Unless, the spot has just being opened up, could be street cleaning, could be peak hour passed. That is the time you will be guaranteed a spot. So, the filter basically search for the end hour of a 'No parking' period. If it overlaps, it will show the spot. If you will be arriving in dt in around two hours, just make the filter show "Next 2 hour", the filter will show all spots that are going to open up in the next 2 hours.

### Use multi trips

DT parking is scarce. This feature allows you to put in multiple parking destination. If one is out of spot, google map will direct you to the next spot without having to put in the next place or looking for signs when driving.

### Sign Up

You can put in your own spots if you sign in.

## How is it different?

Everybody got a parking app. Special power of my website is the filter. While other app filter to see if you can park there. I filter when you can't.
You might ask: what's the point, if I can't even park there? The thing about downtown parking is, usually... I mean almost at all time the free parking is full.
However, there are times when its totally empty. You guessed it, when the 'no parking' timer ends. You are guaranteed a spot. 

## Mobile version?

Mobile is fully supported right now.

## Currently in test phase, and still as a personal project

Every account you registered, or the spots being put in might be removed later. Website maybe shut down at any time.
